# weather-app

- Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

- Display the information on your webpage!
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.

- Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
